# compstatr 0.2.1

* address bug where categorize and filter functions failed when the `var` argument was not an integer variable
* address testing rules related to `epsg` values in new `sf` release
* ensure that upcoming changes with `dplyr` and `tibble` do not impact package

# compstatr 0.2.0

* add functionality for directly scraping crime data into `R`:
    * add `cs_last_update` - checks date of last data release by SLMPD
    * add `cs_create_index` - creates a full tibble of available month tables
    * add `cs_get_data` - downloads a month or year worth of crime tables
    * There is one breaking change for users - to enable these functions, all variable names are standardized into `snake_case` at import. This will impact code that has been written using a prior version of `compstatr`.
* update `README` and `index.Rmd` with "What's New?" sections
