\description{
\code{cs_filter_crime} can be used to subset based on
    specific single UCR categories or common groupings. This can be used
    on any police department's data where codes like \code{31111} (robbery with a firearm)
    or \code{142320} (malicious destruction of property) are used to identify crimes.
}
